If AF is the slope of the curve, the autosens.min/max is the height of the graph, the Y-interval, where Y: dynamic ratio. The curve will always have a sigmoid shape, no matter which autosens.min/max settings are used, meaning these settings have big consequences for the outcome of the computed dynamic ISF. Please be careful setting a too high autosens.max value.
