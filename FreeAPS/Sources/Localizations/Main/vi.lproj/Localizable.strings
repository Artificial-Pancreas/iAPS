"Allows fat and protein to be converted into future carb equivalents using the Warsaw formula of kilocalories divided by 10.\n\nThis spreads the carb equivilants over a maximum duration setting that can be configured from 5-12 hours.\n\nDelay is time from now until the first future carb entry.\n\nInterval in minutes is how many minutes are between entries. The shorter the interval, the smoother the result. 10, 15, 20, 30, or 60 are reasonable choices.\n\nAdjustment factor is how much effect the fat and protein has on the entries. 1.0 is full effect (original Warsaw Method) and 0.5 is half effect. Note that you may find that your normal carb ratio needs to increase to a larger number if you begin adding fat and protein entries. For this reason, it is best to start with a factor of about 0.5 to ease into it.\n\nDefault settings: Time Cap: 8 h, Interval: 30 min, Factor: 0.5, Delay 60 min" = "Cho phép chuyển đổi chất béo và protein thành lượng carb tương đương trong tương lai bằng cách sử dụng công thức kilocalories chia cho 10 của Warsaw.\n\nĐiều này phân bổ lượng carb tương đương trong cài đặt thời lượng tối đa có thể được định cấu hình từ 5-12 giờ.\n\nĐộ trễ là thời gian từ nay cho đến lần nhập carb đầu tiên trong tương lai.\n\nKhoảng thời gian tính bằng phút là số phút giữa các lần nhập. Khoảng thời gian càng ngắn thì kết quả càng mượt. 10, 15, 20, 30 hoặc 60 là những lựa chọn hợp lý.\n\nHệ số điều chỉnh là mức độ ảnh hưởng của chất béo và protein đối với các mục. 1,0 là hiệu ứng đầy đủ (Phương pháp Warsaw gốc) và 0,5 là một nửa hiệu ứng. Lưu ý rằng bạn có thể thấy rằng tỷ lệ carb bình thường của bạn cần tăng lên một con số lớn hơn nếu bạn bắt đầu bổ sung các mục chất béo và protein. Vì lý do này, tốt nhất bạn nên bắt đầu với hệ số khoảng 0,5 để dễ dàng thực hiện.\n\nCài đặt mặc định: Giới hạn thời gian: 8 giờ, Khoảng thời gian: 30 phút, Hệ số: 0,5, Độ trễ 60 phút";
