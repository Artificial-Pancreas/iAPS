It is recommended that the value is set to start at 30, in line with the default, and if you choose to increase this value, do so in no more than 15 minute increments, keeping a close eye on the effects of the changes. Reducing the value will cause UAM to dose less insulin for each SMB. It is not recommended to set this value higher than 60 mins, as this may affect the ability for the algorithm to safely zero temp. It is also recommended that pushover is used when setting the value to be greater than default, so that alerts are generated for any predicted lows or highs." = "默认以30为起点。这是当IOB无法覆盖COB时，UAM作为单个SMB所能提供的基础率时间最大时间。如果你选择的话，这可以使UAM干预更频繁或更迟钝。建议该值从30开始，与默认值一致，如果你选择增加该值，以不超过15分钟为单位，密切关注变化的效果。降低这个值会导致UAM对每个SMB的胰岛素剂量减少。不建议将该值设置为高于60分钟，因为这可能会影响算法回到临时基础的能力。另外，建议在设置该值大于默认值时，使用PushOver，以便对任何预测的低点或高点发出警报。";
