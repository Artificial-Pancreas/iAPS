It is recommended that the value is set to start at 30, in line with the default, and if you choose to increase this value, do so in no more than 15 minute increments, keeping a close eye on the effects of the changes. Reducing the value will cause UAM to dose less insulin for each SMB. It is not recommended to set this value higher than 60 mins, as this may affect the ability for the algorithm to safely zero temp.
