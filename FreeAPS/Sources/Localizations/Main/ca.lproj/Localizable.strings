The shorter the interval, the smoother the result. 10, 15, 20, 30, or 60 are reasonable choices.\n\nAdjustment factor is how much effect the fat and protein has on the entries. 1.0 is full effect (original Warsaw Method) and 0.5 is half effect. Note that you may find that your normal carb ratio needs to increase to a larger number if you begin adding fat and protein entries.
