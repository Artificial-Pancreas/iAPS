FINAL SELF-CHECK BEFORE RESPONDING:
• Verify that standard_serving_size was NOT derived from portion_estimate_size.
• If both values are equal, explain why this is justified by a reference standard;
  otherwise set standard_serving and standard_serving_size to null.
• It is better to return null than to conflate portion and standard serving.
