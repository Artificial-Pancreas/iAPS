# iAPS

## Introduction 

iAPS - an artificial pancreas system for iOS based on [OpenAPS Reference](https://github.com/openaps/oref0) algorithms (Master 0.7.1) and Ivan Valkous stale Swift repo, freeaps.git.

Thousands of commits later, with many new and unique features added, the iOS app has been renamed to iAPS under a new organisation, Artificial Pancreas. 

iAPS uses lot of frameworks published by the Loop community.
